\section*{\color{maestroBlue}Introduction}

Welcome to the Maestro Early Access Program! As an early adopter, you're joining an exclusive group of innovators who will shape the future of AI-assisted software development.

\textbf{Maestro} is an agentic, goal-driven conversational Software Engineering system designed by iGent AI. Built to be your expert partner across all fields of knowledge, Maestro transforms how software is conceived, developed, and deployed.

\section*{\color{maestroBlue}What is Maestro?}

Maestro is more than just a coding assistant – it's a comprehensive software engineering partner that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thinks Autonomously}: Completes complex thoughts through structured reasoning and task execution
    \item \textbf{Codes Expertly}: Creates, modifies, and manages code across multiple languages and frameworks
    \item \textbf{Executes Reliably}: Runs commands, manages environments, and tests solutions in a secure sandbox
    \item \textbf{Collaborates Seamlessly}: Works alongside you to achieve your development goals
\end{itemize}

\section*{\color{maestroBlue}Using Maestro}

\subsection*{Input Box}

\end{center}

The input box is your primary entry point for interacting with the Maestro agent. Here you can type your requests, describe your goals, and engage in conversation to guide the development process.

\subsection*{Upload Files}

Maestro is multimodal and supports a wide variety of file types. You can upload documents, images, code files, data files, and more. Note that while video and audio files are not directly supported, they can be processed through the sandbox environment.

\subsection*{Settings Menu}

The settings menu provides control over your agent session settings, allowing you to customize the experience according to your needs.

\subsection*{Commands}

Maestro supports slash commands for quick actions. These commands can be accessed through the interface buttons or by typing them directly. Commands provide efficient shortcuts for common operations.

\subsection*{Behaviour}

Different operation modes can be switched on or off to adjust how Maestro operates during your session. These modes allow you to fine-tune the agent's behavior to match your workflow.

\subsection*{Memory}

Memory management includes the ability to forget, remember, or compact prior turns in your conversation. This helps maintain context while keeping interactions efficient.

\subsection*{File Operations}

Manage the files that the agent is currently viewing or working with. This includes opening, closing, and navigating between different files in your project.

\subsection*{Utilities}

\subsection*{Source Control Management}

Maestro can clone repositories, create new repositories, and generate pull requests. This integration streamlines your version control workflow directly within the agent interface.

\subsection*{Download}

Create downloadable packages of your work, including individual files, directories, or complete project archives. This feature makes it easy to export your work for deployment or sharing.

\section*{\color{maestroBlue}Getting Started}

Your journey with Maestro begins today. Simply start a conversation, describe your goal, and watch as Maestro transforms your ideas into reality.
