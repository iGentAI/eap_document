Maestro Early Access Program (EAP)
Welcome to the Future of AI-Powered Software Engineering
Introduction
Welcome to the Maestro Early Access Program! As an early adopter, you’re joining an exclusive
group of innovators who will shape the future of AI-assisted software development.
Maestro is an agentic, goal-driven conversational Software Engineering system designed by
iGent AI. Built to be your expert partner across all fields of knowledge, Maestro transforms how
software is conceived, developed, and deployed.

What is Maestro?
Maestro is more than just a coding assistant – it’s a comprehensive software engineering partner
that:
• Thinks Autonomously: Completes complex thoughts through structured reasoning and
task execution
• Codes Expertly: Creates, modifies, and manages code across multiple languages and frameworks
• Executes Reliably: Runs commands, manages environments, and tests solutions in a secure
sandbox
• Collaborates Seamlessly: Works alongside you to achieve your development goals

Using Maestro
User Menu

The user menu provides access to essential settings and configuration options for your Maestro
session.
Light/Dark Mode
Toggle between light and dark themes to match your preferred working environment. The interface
automatically adjusts colors and contrast to ensure comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.
Link GitHub
Connect your GitHub account to enable Maestro’s source control management capabilities. This
authentication allows the agent to:
• Work with your private repositories
• Create new repositories under your account or organizations
• Generate pull requests on your behalf
• Clone and manage both public and private repositories
Once linked, Maestro can seamlessly integrate with your GitHub workflow, making version
control operations as simple as natural language commands.
Manage Credentials
The credential management system allows you to securely store and use:
• API keys for third-party services
• Environment variables for your applications
• Authentication tokens and secrets
• Complete .env files for project configurations
Important: To use stored credentials in your session, you must explicitly activate them by
either:
• Using the /credentials command
• Asking the agent to activate specific credentials when needed
This explicit activation ensures your sensitive information is only exposed when necessary and
under your direct control.

Input Box

The input box is your primary entry point for interacting with the Maestro agent. Here you
can type your requests, describe your goals, and engage in conversation to guide the development
process.
