Maestro Early Access Program (EAP)
Welcome to the Future of AI-Powered Software Engineering
Introduction
Welcome to the Maestro Early Access Program! As an early adopter, you’re joining an exclusive
group of innovators who will shape the future of AI-assisted software development.
Maestro is an agentic, goal-driven conversational Software Engineering system designed by
iGent AI. Built to be your expert partner across all fields of knowledge, Maestro transforms how
software is conceived, developed, and deployed.

What is Maestro?
Maestro is more than just a coding assistant – it’s a comprehensive software engineering partner
that:
• Thinks Autonomously: Completes complex thoughts through structured reasoning and
task execution
• Codes Expertly: Creates, modifies, and manages code across multiple languages and frameworks
• Executes Reliably: Runs commands, manages environments, and tests solutions in a secure
sandbox
• Collaborates Seamlessly: Works alongside you to achieve your development goals

Using Maestro
Input Box

The input box is your primary entry point for interacting with the Maestro agent. Here you
can type your requests, describe your goals, and engage in conversation to guide the development
process.

Upload Files
Maestro is multimodal and supports a wide variety of file types. You can upload documents, images,
code files, data files, and more. Note that while video and audio files are not directly supported,
they can be processed through the sandbox environment.

Settings Menu
The settings menu provides control over your agent session settings, allowing you to customize the
experience according to your needs.

Commands
Maestro supports slash commands for quick actions. These commands can be accessed through the
interface buttons or by typing them directly. Commands provide efficient shortcuts for common
operations.

Behaviour
Different operation modes can be switched on or off to adjust how Maestro operates during your
session. These modes allow you to fine-tune the agent’s behavior to match your workflow.

Memory
Memory management includes the ability to forget, remember, or compact prior turns in your
conversation. This helps maintain context while keeping interactions efficient.

File Operations
Manage the files that the agent is currently viewing or working with. This includes opening, closing,
and navigating between different files in your project.

Utilities
Source Control Management
Maestro can clone repositories, create new repositories, and generate pull requests. This integration
streamlines your version control workflow directly within the agent interface.

Download
Create downloadable packages of your work, including individual files, directories, or complete
project archives. This feature makes it easy to export your work for deployment or sharing.

Getting Started
Your journey with Maestro begins today. Simply start a conversation, describe your goal, and
watch as Maestro transforms your ideas into reality.
